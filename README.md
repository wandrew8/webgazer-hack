# Eye Gazer Application

This application was built in four hours as part of a hackathon with Mintbean. This app utilizes the webgazer.js library to track a users' eye movements and heatmap.js to visually show the hot spots of where the users attention is focused. 

This hackathon was a great way to get familiar with new libraries. I utilized two new libraries and though I certainly didn't accomplish all my goals for this project, it was still a great learning experience.
